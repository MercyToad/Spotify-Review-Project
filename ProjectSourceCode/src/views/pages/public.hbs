If the user likes a song, they can view similar songs, which will return a list of songs that have similar attributes and were rated highly among users who also rated the requested song highly.</p>

      <p class="public-card-body">Using the Spotify API to not only retrieve the actual song/artist/album, but to retrieve pre-defined Spotify song characteristics, we will be able to let users review any song on Spotify, and allow their review to influence their song recommendations.</p>
