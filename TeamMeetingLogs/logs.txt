During our meeting, we talked about was some of the features that we plan to implement, 
such as users being able to view thier profiles and suggesting songs to them. 
We also talked about our wireframes and who will be focusing on what parts of the project. 
The current plan is to have Juan and Nisha work on the front-end, Adie and Nisha work on the backend, 
and David work on the API and database, with each of us also helping where it is needed. 
Another topic that we talked about was the Spotify API and how we are going to access it and attempt to use it with our app.




11/6:
Duration: ~10 minutes

During our meeting, we talked about that we were able to obtain Spotify's API, how we 
started working on the login, registration, home pages, and the tables for the data 
the app will use. In the next week, we plan on finishing the login and registration pages, as well as
continuing to work on the home page and making sure that the database works with Spotify's API. We still 
plan to mostly have Juan and Nisha work on the front-end, Adie and Nisha on the backend, 
and David and Zach on the API and database.





11/12:
Duration: ~15 minutes

During our meeting, we talked about how we were able to get our login, registration, 
and home pages mostly finished, with only minor adjustments needed. We are planning to 
create the template for the profile page, the forms for when the user 
is making a review/rating, and make sure that features are working as 
intended with the Spotify API, with the same roles that we have been using






11/19:
Duration ~15 minutes

We talked about making sure we are able to finish all of the features that we want
to implement. We also talked about trying to get the API key to automatically renew,
instead of having to use postman to obtain one every hour. We also made sure to set
up a time for our presentation.
