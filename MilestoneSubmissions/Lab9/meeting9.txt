11/6:
Duration: ~10 minutes

During our meeting, we talked about that we were able to obtain Spotify's API, how we 
started working on the login, registration, home pages, and the tables for the data 
the app will use. In the next week, we plan on finishing the login and registration pages, as well as
continuing to work on the home page and making sure that the database works with Spotify's API. We still 
plan to mostly have Juan and Nisha work on the front-end, Adie and Nisha on the backend, 
and David and Zach on the API and database.
