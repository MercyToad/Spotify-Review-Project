Duration: ~15-20 minutes

During our meeting, we talked about was some of the features that we plan to implement, 
such as users being able to view thier profiles and suggesting songs to them. 
We also talked about our wireframes and who will be focusing on what parts of the project. 
The current plan is to have Juan and Nisha work on the front-end, Adie and Nisha work on the backend, 
and David work on the API and database, with each of us also helping where it is needed. 
Another topic that we talked about was the Spotify API and how we are going to access it and attempt to use it with our app.
